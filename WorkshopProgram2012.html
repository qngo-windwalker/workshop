EASIE handles some 1,200 to 1,300 applications each year, mostly from local education agencies (LEAs).  The EASIE system allows users to select or type their responses into a user-friendly interface that accepts the data into a database.  OIE staff will provide updates on the proposed enhancements for the next application cycle.  The presentation will include five primary application phases:  Registration; Part I Indian student counts; Initial calculation of awards; EASIE Part II objectives and budget components; and Final certification of the EASIE application.

Discussions will center on the importance of how families, educators, and communities can work together to improve teaching, learning and parental involvement.  The panel will cover how parental involvement/engagement activities play a key role in reaching high student achievement and addressing local needs.  Through research and effective practices, children do better in schools when parents are involved in education.  As parents participate in school activities and when schools collaborate with parents, the parental roles and responsibilities are highly valued in decision-making about their children’s education.</span></p>
