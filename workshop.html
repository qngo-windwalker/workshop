        <p>Tribal consultations have raised our awareness of the interest in using education data.  The presenters will discuss data of interest on American Indian and Alaska Native students, how the data can be used, how to get access to the data, and limitations of the data.  This session also will provide highlights from the recently released 2011 National Indian Education Study (NIES) report.  The study provides leaders, educators, and the public with information about the academic performance in reading and mathematics of American Indian and Alaska Native fourth- and eighth-graders as well as their exposure to Native American culture.  The presentation will explain how stakeholders can gain access to the study results. </p>

        <p>Migrant children often experience significant interruptions in their education as a result of their migratory lifestyle.  The Migrant Education Program, the High School Equivalency Program, and the College Assistance Migrant Program are programs designed specifically for migrant children and youth.  The purpose of this presentation is to examine how these programs and initiatives, supported by the Office of Migrant Education, work together to successfully bridge gaps in children’s education and promote high school graduation as well as post-secondary educational attainment.  Participants will discuss and explore ideas for implementing these types of programs and initiatives in their own work with at-risk populations.</p>

Staff from ED’s Family Policy Compliance Office will explain three ways that, consistent with the new FERPA regulations, tribes can access data; (2) Administration of Grants: Many tribes are recipients of discretionary grants as well as direct formula grants. The Director of the Department’s Risk Management Service and attorneys will discuss compliance with federal regulations, including audit requirements, allowable costs, fiscal control measures, and generally how to stay out of trouble so that your grant can be continued. </p>

To support this vision, the U.S. Department of Education has begun working with educators to spark a national conversation about teaching and develop a comprehensive policy for transforming education for the 21st century, including rethinking the way we recruit, prepare, credential, support, advance and compensate teachers and principals. The Department calls this work the RESPECT Project.</p>

EASIE handles some 1,200 to 1,300 applications each year, mostly from local education agencies (LEAs).  The EASIE system allows users to select or type their responses into a user-friendly interface that accepts the data into a database.  OIE staff will provide updates on the proposed enhancements for the next application cycle.  The presentation will include five primary application phases:  Registration; Part I Indian student counts; Initial calculation of awards; EASIE Part II objectives and budget components; and Final certification of the EASIE application.  Current and former grantees and those applying for the first time are encouraged to attend.</p>

        <p>Parental involvement has always been a centerpiece of the Department of Education programs.  As a panel, the staff from the Department will provide a brief overview of parental involvement/engagement requirements for Federal Technical Assistance workshop participants.  The programs included on this panel have their own unique parental involvement policies and requirements.  Discussions will center on the importance of how families, educators, and communities can work together to improve teaching, learning and parental involvement.  The panel will cover how parental involvement/engagement activities play a key role in reaching high student achievement and addressing local needs.  Through research and effective practices, children do better in schools when parents are involved in education.  As parents participate in school activities and when schools collaborate with parents, the parental roles and responsibilities are highly valued in decision-making about their children’s education.</p>
